# {{ page.title }}
One of the most striking departures from Tolkien in the Rings of Power show is the depiction of authority. Every protagonist we've been introduced to has been depicted as an unappreciated underling. They all are *right* about something, they're all ignored, and they all have a harsher foil in a position of authority over them. This is true for both the original Tolkien characters and the new invented characters and for the former, it's remarkable how they've had to change characters to fit this mold in a way that is clearly intentional.

### Nori vs. everyone

![Nori is curious!](/images/nori-1.png)

First and gentlest is the Harfoot Nori. She's the fantasy cliché curious child who can't help but explore until she stumbles into something that draws the ire of her elders. In just the first episode before she does anything out of the ordinary we get two scenes of Nori being scolded by both her stepmother and the elder Sadoc just for being too curious.

We don't know where Nori's character will end up, but inevitably her people will end up on a collision course with the broader world and Nori will be the one best equipped to save them because of her curiosity. Nori's foil is her whole community. She's not standing up to an unjust ruler, she's just defying stifling cultural norms.

### Arondir vs. Watchwarden Revion

Arondir gets a scene in the pilot episode notable because it has no direct plot relevance, it just serves as character development. That development is of course establishing that Arondir has empathy for the underclass of men that he's been stationed over. Likeable enough. To emphasize the point, Arondir is given a commander who corrects him.

> [Arondir] 79 Years I've been stationed here ... it has changed much, Watchwarden. <br><br>
[Watchwarden] But the Men who live here have not. The blood of those who stood with Morgoth still darkens their veins. <br><br>
[Arondir] That was long ago, Watchwarden. <br><br>
... <br>
[Watchwarden] Mark this, Arondir, that for 79 years, you've kept watch over the men and women of Tirharad not because of what their ancestors once did, but because of who they still are. And be grateful that you need never see them again.

The only defining character development we get of the Watchwarden is wholly unnecessary callousness towards the outsiders and a splash of arrogance. Given his demise in episode 3, it seems safe to conclude that was his only purpose. His whole character serves specifically to establish not just Arondir's humble identification with the men of the southlands but that he's more *heroic* for doing so because he did so in opposition to authority. We're meant to understand that Arondir isn't just kind, he's brave for being kind.

### Galadriel vs. Gil-galad

![Someone has to keep their great aunt in check!](/images/galadriel-defiance.png)

The opening episodes go to great lengths to clarify Gil-galad's authority over and strained patience for Galadriel in part because it's such a large departure from what Tolkien fans would expect. Instead of being the most senior and certainly the most powerful Noldor elf remaining in Middle Earth, Galadriel has been made into a plucky, defiant military officer. It's hard to understate how much of a change this represents and how much character reshaping was necessary to portray the "[2nd] greatest of the Noldor" (Galadriel) speaking *truth to power* to her grand nephew (Gil-galad). It's like making a biopic about Jeff Bezos in which the former Amazon CEO, in an impulsive but *really brave* moment, stands up to his (self-appointed) successor for not prioritizing the customer enough. Not only did it not happen, it takes intentional reimagining to portray it that way.

It's not just that Galadriel is remade to be the little guy though, it's also that Gil-galad is made to be vaguely *opposed* to her. The show doesn't specify if he truly thinks Sauron is gone or merely wants to get Galadriel out of the way and it doesn't particularly matter. What matters is that he views her tenacity and conviction as a problem- a view that will inevitably prove to be shortsighted. 

In Tolkien's story, Gil-galad is not only very receptive to his Great Aunt, he's one of the wariest elves of all about the lingering threat. I suspect the decision to recast Tolkien's core characters so differently felt, to the showrunners, like a necessary step to making Galadriel a protagonist. Tolkien's equally proud but wise, patient and defensive version of Galadriel isn't a good candidate to drive the plot forward every episode. She's too wise to be a troublemaker and until the full emergence of Sauron, she has nothing to strive against day to day because no one is a meaningful challenge to her own power. So to make her relatable she's made small and to make her righteous, she's given a punitive authority figure as a foil.

### Elendil vs. the court

Elendil has been changed to an unknown Naval officer, remembered only by the chancellor for being "originally" of a noble line. In Tolkien's world, Elendil is Lord one of the most prominent houses in Númenor. His father was arguably the 2nd most important person in the royal court and in fact would have been the rightful king of Númenor had the succession laws originally passed through to the oldest *child* instead of oldest son. Elendil's family inherited both the palantiri and the ring of Barahir and it's unimaginable that Elendil, one of the most powerful men in Númenor, wouldn't be recognized throughout the city much less in the royal court.

![That's your cousin!](/images/elendil-introduction-1.png)

![Around here folks just call him Strider](/images/elendil-introduction-2.png)

As we've just begun to see play out, Elendil is going to be caught between his righteous faith and the threat of punishment by the royal court, primarily by Pharazon. And inevitably, Elendil is going to be proven right and find himself in a very important leadership role despite his apparently forgettable origins. His character change is less dramatic than Galadriel's in that even in Tolkien's world, he's certainly up against a hostile society and a politically powerful opponent in Pharazon to act as a foil. Given how well Tolkien's original story fits the bill, you have to wonder why our script is going out of its way to make him less important anyways.

## Unjust authority

The common formula is that all of our protagonists storylines have invented or *reinvented* to conform to a remarkably consistent assumption: *authority is inherently unjust*. If authority is unjust, those in authority must have streaks of ignorance or arrogance. If authority is unjust, any protagonist opposing authority in some form is doing good.

Nori needs to be told to conform so that her non-conforming curiosity is *brave* rather than reckless. Arondir needs to be reminded to hate the men of Tirharad so that his attraction to Bronwyn is *love* rather than selfishness. Galadriel needs to be reprimanded by Gil-galad so that her obsession with evil is *righteous* *conviction* rather than egotism. And Elendil needs to be accused of treason so that his interest in Galadriel represents *loyalty* rather than politics.

Given that he centered his entire Lord of the Rings trilogy around a metaphor (the ring) for how power corrupts, it can't be said that Tolkien doesn't possess a healthy distrust of power. His Middle Earth is chock full of power hungry men, elves and dwarves that inevitably lead others into ruin and we'll get to see plenty of those in this show. But it's equally unfair to depict authority and power as inherently unjust in Tolkien's world. Gil-galad, Galadriel and Elendil are all authority figures and leaders and they are simultaneously wise.

We're left to wonder why all these characters have been subverted and why authority figure foils have been added and I think it's unavoidable that the showrunners have done so in anticipation of their 2022 viewership.

## Modern cynicism

Imagine an unaltered version of Elendil's storyline. The prospect of an influential nobleman being *righteously* opposed to an ignorant public is... distasteful. If we learned he'd been born into power and wealth, we'd all have the voice in our heads questioning if he's really on the side of justice. We're thoroughly trained to not admire the rich and powerful or at least not to admit it.

Perhaps more insidiously, if Elendil was portrayed with all the authority and power he has in Tolkien's story, we wouldn't see a beleaguered man trying to do what's right against all odds, we'd see a political adversary. And to our 2022 eyes, he'd be tainted. When I first watched Game of Thrones it felt *real* to me because it captured what, in my heart, I already thought was true: those who try to be good will be crushed by those who are willing to do what it takes to be powerful. Without fail, you can assume anyone who has been around long enough has moved their principles to the backseat so machiavellianism can be their copilot. We can't imagine an authority figure with genuinely righteous motivations, much less one engaged in politics. Only the powerless can be pure.

In short, I think the showrunners are right to believe that we, the audience, will only find underdogs and not authority figures heroic. Maybe we're like this because of the abysmally low trust we have in our real life civic leaders. Maybe we've just been trained to expect this by House of Cards and Game of Thrones. I'm not going to speculate, I'm just going to assert that it hasn't always been this way. This isn't a timeless complaint that every generation makes. It's a unique moment we're in where we equate authority with the abuse of it. You can see this sweeping trend in the [plunging drop in Americans' confidence in our leaders](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx). In [biographical accounts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2279.Truman) you can see how the public's veneration of the office of the President made Truman, despite his questionable qualifications, *more* *popular* when he stepped into the position of authority instead of more criticized. And contrary to *Hamilton*'s dramatization, you can read [historical accounts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25843585-the-true-history-of-the-american-revolution) of King George's popularity and perceived legitimacy amongst American colonists even as they prepared to rebel against what they perceived as illegitimate taxation imposed by Parliament. Neither positions of authority nor those that occupy them have always been assumed unjust.

## The source of power

If it seems like a contradiction that power corrupts but at the same time, authority can be just, we're missing a core truth about Tolkien's Middle Earth. All power flows from the creator. It often flows in the form of wisdom passed down from the Valar to the elves and then to men. It often flows in the form of beauty both through the Valar and through creation itself. And sometimes it flows in forms that look like magic or miracles to those who don't understand it.

None of these forms are easy to manipulate to serve our own ends. Those who wield wisdom and beauty cannot help but be a force for good. They're merely a conduit. But Middle Earth is a fallen creation full so it's of creatures like us who want power and control for ourselves. Since it's beyond our ability to genuinely create power on our own, we use the gifts we do have to bend the material world until it serves us, hence orcs and rings of power and wealth.

True power doesn't come from the flimsy facade of the material world, however. True power, flowing from the creator, flows without any care or attention to who wields material wealth and influence. Those things are inconsequential to someone who created the entire world. And so true power acts through the small as much as through the big. This is why Tolkien's world is full of plucky Davids triumphing over Goliaths.

But just because true power acts with a will of its own doesn't mean it's random. It's recognizable, knowable, and discernible because it as absolute and immutable as its source. Those who have experienced and seen power, those who have studied and learned how it works can have a genuine knowledge of it, and therein lies legitimate authority.

We're going to see this play out very explicitly with the creation of the rings. The three eleven rings, created independently of Sauron and with the best of elven craft, wisdom and beauty, will be immensely powerful and used for immensely good outcomes. The one ring, created *with the intent to control* all the others, is warped. There's no legitimate use of this power, and all that try will be warped by it.

This is why in Tolkien's world there's a sharp distinction between those who *seek* authority and those who have it placed upon them. Possessing authority is not corrupting for the same reasons wisdom and beauty are not corrupting. But the desire to have authority, and the act of seizing power, does corrupt us.

Tolkien’s synthesis is simple. Neither authority nor power are inherently unjust, but because those that seek them *are*, it's hard to believe the truth unless you know of the all-powerful creator who is the source of both. Maybe we’ll get to see him peeking out here and there.
